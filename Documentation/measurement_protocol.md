# Fluorescence measurement protocol

### Crystal removal
- Remove crystals one at a time in to their boxes.
- Do not remove the reference crystals in positions 0, 11, 10.
1. Gently remove the wheel cover.
2. Use clean tweezers to hold the crystal casing.
3. Use clean rod to push gently on the crystal casing from the left through the hole until it is released from the wheel.
4. Place crystal back in its box and place box back in its drawer before moving to the next crystal.

### Crystal placement
- Place crystals in the wheel one by one.
1. Move the wheel from the pc so that a free position is facing you.
2. Use clean tweezers to take crystal out of its box and immediately place the box in the appropriate slot in the box holder with the same number as the position on the wheel.
3. Gently and patiently insert the crystal into the wheel with the number three facing you and on your bottom left (so it is closest to both excitation and emission mirrors).

### Alignment 
1. Move to reference sapphire crystal (should be in position 0).
2. Check that beam and its reflection from retro-reflector are aligned through center of the crystal.
3. Measure room light leakage for 100 seconds with excitation shutter closed and spectrograph input shutter open. If any significant leakage is visible make sure door is closed properly. If not possible to get rid of leakage, shut light in lab for the rest of the measurements.
4. Open excitation shutter and find reference signal. Start video at 1 sec exposures and optimize motor positions. Start with emission mirror position and then crystal wheel position. Compare maximum intensity with previous reference.
5. Set optimized position as the zero position.
